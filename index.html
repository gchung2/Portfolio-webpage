    <h3>Who am I?</h3>
    <p>After graduating college, I went to work as an adminstrative assistant in a company. I realized that I wanted to change my career and get a job as a software engineer.</p>
    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>While taking this course, I've learn a great deal about web development and while it's fun to look and create your own work, I think it will be fun to collabreate and create something better with more people that will bring in new ideas that I wouldn't normally think of.</p>
    <p>Outside this course you could see me either playing video games or doing art. I am fond of collecting older games and have a large collection. I also enjoy creating digital art on my tablet.</p>
